    <h3>Short description of the camera</h3>
    <p>Despite its billing as a 'basic' model, the Sony a7 III is a supremely capable full frame camera. Though it doesn't have the most megapixels or shoot the fastest bursts, its well-judged mix of resolution, speed, features and price point make it an easy recommendation for all kinds of photographers and all kinds of photography.</p>
    <h3>Key features of the camera</h3>
    <li>24MP full frame BSI CMOS sensor</li>
    <li>93% autofocus coverage (693 phase detection points, 425 for contrast detection)</li>
    <li>Oversampled 4K/24p video taken from full width 6K (cropped-in 5K for 30p)</li>
    <li>In-body image stabilization</li>
    <li>10 fps continuous shooting</li>
    <li>2.36M-dot OLED viewfinder, 0.78x magnification</li>
    <li>Touchscreen</li>
    <p>Compared to its predecessor, the Sony a7 III has been updated in almost every way; when compared to other similarly priced full frame options, the a7 III looks to be a cut above in many respects. For generalist photographers, wedding and event shooters and even sports specialists, the a7 III gets an awful lot of things just right. But as with previous Sony mirrorless full-frame cameras, there are some foibles that persist with this new model.</p>
